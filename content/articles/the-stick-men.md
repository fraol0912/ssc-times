\    ***The Stick-men***

 "I'm not that hungry dad" Filimon said,sitting across his father. He and his family were eating at his aunt's restaurant as they always do on epiphany. It was a family tradition. "You barley had a bite! " said his father mid chew."This is your dinner, you need to eat something "he swallowed."I could eat a samosas.." the boy suggested. "well they don't serve that here now, do they?" his father replied. "I know a vendor who sells samosas down by the church" his aunt said as she served their drinks with a clank. She always did the serving when it's them. "Go get yourself some, hun" she smiled sliding him a 20. That was the last time he saw Rosa smile. "I want to go too!" shrieked his 9 year old little sister beside him. Betty was never separated from her brother. "Now now,you both know it's not good for..." "Leave them be, Alem" his wife interrupted "Go on you two.. And be quick about it."

Walking to the church, Filimon had to make a few stops as his sister loved her reflection. She would pause when they get near a building, adjust her dress, make faces at her brother's twin and keep on skipping. When she stopped for the 6th time, he could see a group of men chanting and singing behind them. They had their sticks as usual but something felt different this time. Were they this many last year? He saw a glimmer of silver at one of the men's belt as it shone against the setting sun. He turned to examine it better but stopped as he felt his sister tug at him. "samosas!!" she pointed.

"That would be 15...."the vendor paused. The boy turned to hand his sister the snack and saw a cluster of people running towards them. That was when he heard the screams. The horrible sound that would haunt the rest of his life. " Beti!" he ran towards his sister. He grabbed her by the hand and ran to the restaurant. Right into the crowd. A crowd that was frantically running in every direction. Everyone who rushed past them had a terrified look on their face. It was them. It was the men he..

Pain. Blood. Silence.

"Wake up, Filimon", a familiar whisper "wake up". He tried, he really did. "wake up!" the voice was even more demanding now. He opened his eyes and everything came back in a second. He heard guns and his head throbbed with every shot. He rubbed his temple and lowered bloody palms. A large bloodied rock sat in front of him. That must've done the damage. BANG! Beti... . He tried to stand up and fell back down, his leg was in pain. It was trampled over by the crowd. Bang! He heaved himself up and searched frantically for his sister. "Beti!" he screamed into the chaos. BANG! "RUN!" said the voice, it was his aunt's voice in his head. He did. Everyone did. He dragged his left foot across the pavement and limped as fast as he could. He couldn't have been unconscious for more than two minutes. The last thing he remembered before going down, hit by the still flying rocks everywhere, was his sister being buried in the crowd. Pushed off by the shifting mass.

He used the darkened corners to hide himself as the men he saw on his way to the church, the men with the sticks, smash in people's heads. Disembody heads from necks. Blood splattered all over the street. There were few policemen to guard the streets in this small secluded town, and a holiday that needed a gathering was great for a mass murder. A mass murder as this one. Filimon would have been frozen by terror and slumped to the ground if it were not for the incomparable urge of finding his sister. She was more important than anything.

He could smell smoke as he turned to see two men leading a group of children into an alley. His eyes started welling up. Tear gas. His vision started blurring but he could make out the patches of blue figures running amidst the crowd.

 He took a path between the buildings as he rubbed his burning eyes. He reached the backdoor of his aunt's restaurant. He pushed the  door open with a grunt  and entered. "Dad..?" he said to the silent mess. The tables and chairs  were upturned. plates were smashed into pieces and scattered all over the place. His aunt's favorite painting on the wall was slashed and torn. He remembered the day he gave it to her. "Dad!" he was louder this time. Glass cracked beneath his feet as he made his way to up the stairs. Few painful steps and he looked up to see a man pointing a gun at him from the top of the stairs. "Filimon!" the man said as Filimon run up the stairs and embraced him.

     "Where's your sister?" Alem immediately asked.

The boy looked up to his dad and then dropped his eyes. "I lost her...I lost her, dad...but there are a group of them now by the... There were so many people...then the rock...I lost her.."

   "We'll find her, son. I promise we'll find her and her back." his dad said to him, Filimon's head under his chin as he soothed his son.

The boy wailed into his father's arms.

                 \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

 Still in his father's embrace, through tear-blurred eyes, Filimon could see a familiar figure slouched against the far wall; it was his mom. Her body was shaking and her eyes wondered - staring at everything yet seeing nothing. He could feel the absence of someone else in the room. After all Absence and Presence were an inverted mirror of each other: twins in being felt without even looking for them.

        "Dad, where's auntie?" he asked with a shaking voice. Filimon had no idea the answer to that was beginning of the end of his old life.

         His dad's body immediately tensed and he gently loosened his hug. He wanted his son to see his eyes when he tells him of what shook his mother, a grown woman, to her core and sent her into a state of oblivion. He knew words are, sometimes, never enough. He knew words would cower and hide in moments of great need ,and when you found them, they hold on fiercely trying not to come out, getting stuck and forming a lump in your throat. And he knew, even though words have immense power, only the eyes are the true vessels of emotion.

       "After... When we heard people screaming and then...gun shots, I started running towards where you and your sister gone to after telling your mom and ...aunt to go the other way...towards what must have been safety...but...gunshots...too many...they started booming behind me..." There were tears brimming under his eyes, and it was getting harder to continue " God!! They were waiting for them...waiting for us to try to escape.... They barricaded the road..and...they started shooting...your aunt...she was in front.. it was so.. We didn't....she saved your mom..."

     The last words were too heavy to reach Filimon through the air. They dropped to the floor and pushed against him like a tide. It was too hard to stand, his legs buckled under the pressure and he fell on to his knees. A new flood of tears was streaming down his face. He tried to, but couldn't scream. Memories of his aunt rushed in his mind, pushing the grief out of him. Tears are the blood of our soul, and they kept flowing out, for Filimon's soul was punctured. Oh, how it broke the soul when the person that gave you so many memories becomes nothing but a memory.

     Suddenly, there was a loud bang as the front door was opened. A pair of slow footsteps started echoing in the lower floor, announcing danger. Filimon was jerked away from the flood of emotions he was drowning in. Looking back, that was the moment that saved him from becoming whatever grief turned his mom into.

     His father was already crouched behind one of the upturned tables, pointing a gun from the top of the stairs with a well trained manner. The footsteps reached the bottom of the stairs, halted for a moment, then continued climbing up. Filimon slowly went to his dad and crouched beside him. The rest of the few people in the room have  already taken hiding spots very stealthily as if this was something they have been practicing for. His mother was still sitting in the far corner, well-hidden but unaware of any danger. Filimon prayed the ones outside won't be drawn in by the gunfire sound.

     They saw the head first, wrapped around by the bandanna most of the murderers were wearing. There was a smile plastered to his face; his dad shot and the man had a hole for an eye now. The body fell down the stairs and made a dull thump.

                                                                \* \* \* \* \* \*

     The room was dead quiet but a song named "Death is in the air tonight" by The *Stick-men*( the name Filimon decided to give the murderers after seeing the man his dad killed sprawled on the floor  with his stick next to him) was playing in everyone's mind. A song they've never heard before, but one they all knew by heart. Death strives and grows within us as well as life does. And when the end comes, death takes over us as it's part of the treaty it made with life - a truce that gave them equal power over all. We're death's and we're life's, and time is the judge of the one to take control.

      Not an hour through the end of Filimon's old world, everyone looks to buckle under the deadly atmosphere.  Death awaits its moment for long, and when its time comes, it's never patient, and it's never fast enough either.Nature is...weird. It forces us to adopt even to the most peculiar one; death. In the new world to come, Filimon would live through too many deaths, escape it's clutch time to time, and on more than one occasions, be its agent. Survival is nothing but being an agent of death, so that you won't be its victim.

                                             \* \* \* \* \* \*

Filimon's dad was almost done with wearing the cloth they took off the dead stick-man. Danger brought opportunity for safety with it. His dad was going to disguise himself as one of the stick-men and take his mom and Filimon out of this hell hole as his hostages, after finding Betty.

Mr. Ahmed was back from "scouting" the area so that they could make sense of what's happening. He was short and muscular man that served with Alem in the Navy for seven years. They both met Filimon's mom and her sister Rosa on the first night they left the Navy to have a more settled down life, and the opportunity presented itself. After 2 years, both of them were married to the women  on the same day. Needless to say, Ahmed's and Rosa's union was frowned upon and unapproved by most because of their religion difference. Despite everyone's belief, two of them had the most loving marriage. They were a symbol of love, you might say. *Were.* I'd love to tell you Love survives the death of a partner. But, Love is a sliver of the greater creation that must be shared between two people. Without a receiver giving back the love you give off your soul, you'll only be bleeding yourself till there's no recovery from it. Love will be nothing but memories; memories of pain.

Although both men had lost their wives (Filimon's mom was soon to be a shelling of the woman she once was), they were soldiers and they stayed firm, or at least, tried to for the sake of the others.

"They've barricaded all the exits of this damned place, and they're in open fire with the  police force that arrived there. There are only the alleyways left, you can escape through the forest once you pass that but they're holding the hostages there too. Although I have no idea what they'll need hostages for. They seem to be in control, eh?" Ahmed continued, "And some of the polices... They..they were siding with the them. I don't  think this is just  a terrorist attack on our secluded village, Alem. This feels too organized and very well planned. Maybe it's a...."

"Revolution. " Alem finished and Ahmed nodded. Filimon was sitting next to them, but Alem continued since he needs to know everything to survive this, "A revolution against the whole nation, not just the government. God!!  We may be witnessing a genocide here. More police would've come here to help if they weren't held off some other place, wouldn't they?" Alem had a distant look in his eyes. He seemed scared. Both of them do. Despite the years in the Navy, fear was new for both of them. And *it*  scared them.

There was an unnerving silence. Finally, Ahmed said "I hope...I really hope we're wrong." And he stood up to give his best friend what he didn't know was their last goodbye." You're not coming with us? " Alem asked when he saw the look on his friend's face. "No" Ahmed said. "There's still someone I'll need to say goodbye to. I can't leave her buried under corpses.  I want to  give her a proper farewell." Alem tried to tell him it was no use, but didn't dare to. He knew how much she meant to him. He simply nodded and handed him the gun "At least keep this with you.." He shushed Ahmed when he protested "I can't risk firing it when the shots outside are almost silent. It will draw in danger. Take it" Ahmed took the gun and they hugged for the last time. "May we meet again" they said to each other. Alem gave his friend one last look, picked up his wife by the arms, and went out the back door with his son beside him.

                                                               \* \* \* \* *

     Head bowed and body slumped, Filimon marched through the town he grew up in, with his mom next to him and his dad holding a stick behind them - a town brutally destroyed in a matter of an hour. There were  very few buildings that weren't reduced to ash. He was surprised to see that the church was one of them.Most vehicles were still intact. The stick-men were probably short of cars, he thought.

     The street was covered with corpses. Some were beaten to the point where they can't be recognized. . Filimon quickly looked away. His aunt was one of them now. He was suddenly flooded by her memories as he finally accepted it. She's gone. He can't think about that now. He must be strong. For Betty. The one who's still alive.

    As they passed the alleys between the small buildings, he noticed there were dozens of hostages in each of them. Separated by sex and age, although all the children were together in one part. The alley they hopped Betty was in. He wanted to ask his dad why they were keeping this many people as hostages, but thought better of it. You don't often see the hostage charting with a murderous psychopath.

Finally, they reached the alley were the children were held at. There were perhaps 50 of them, their age ranging from 7 - 16, Filimon guessed. This alley was open on both ways and it led out to the forest then the high ground clearing he knew well. Filimon marveled at the chance of escaping. Only one issue. It was, of course, being guarded by two stick men. He was surprised to see one of them was a woman. If you're mind is infested with evil, what you've got between your legs doesn't matter. The man was holding a pistol in his hands, and the woman a machete. They seem to be short of guns. Was that why they were keeping the hostages?

The stick-men stared at them as if they were waiting for an explanation.

"I found them hiding behind one of the burnt buildings." Alem said at last. The male stickman spat at Fillimon's mom and asked "how old is the boy?"

"He's 15" Alem said, trying to imitate the slightly off accent the stickman had.

"And why did you bring  the woman here?" the lady asked, her face looking satisfied when she noticed 'the woman' was on the brink of insanity.

"I thought I'd  bring the  boy first" Alem replied.  Filimon thought he saw suspicion pass through her red-shot eyes, but it was immediately replaced by a look of complete naivete.

"Put the boy here and go on then." The man said and turned his face towards the group of kids to light a cigarette. Alem pushed Filimon none too gently to the middle of the kids and turned away as if to go.

He suddenly made a double back and punched the woman in the throat. She reflectively  put her hands over her neck and made a gargling sound before she hit the ground. The sound made the man turn around, pistol in hand, but Alem's military trained muscles were too quick. He dashed into him and they crashed to the ground. The gun sprawled away to the middle of the group of kids.

Filimon quickly sprang to his feet and made a quick scan over the group. All of them were staring at their feet as instructed by the two stick-men. At the far back, he saw the bright yellow dress sticking out from the white holiday dresses. He ran to her, careful not to step over the others. Some of them started looking up. He could hear grunts and dull thumps as the two men fought behind him. He reached his sister and called out her name slowly.

She looked up, and she was actually...smiling. There were flat rocks in her hand to play "Klblbosh" with. He understood what had happened and smiled. she had locked herself in her imagination when things started going wrong as he always advised her. He knelled down and started untying her hands. The others started looking up to him and he decided he'd have to help them too.

When he finally  got his sister free and stood up, the stick-man was on top of his father, strangling him. Filimon started running towards them but halted when he saw his mother. The thought of losing another one  of her loved one seemed to bring her back to reality. She had picked up a huge stone and in a second, the stick-man was lying on the ground with a pool of blood beneath him.

His mother's hand was still shaking. Alem got to his feet after a struggle, red faced, and hugged his wife tight. He had noticed her sanity trying to fight back when she saved his life. And he thought there was hope for her after all. I must admit, he was almost right. *.*

     Filimon and his sister continued untying the other children hurriedly, and from the corner of his eye he saw the woman approach his parents with the machete in her hand. Alem was facing the other way, his wife's face buried between his chest. Filimon tried to shout, but his voice betrayed him. His sister saw what was happening  and shrieked. Alem turned around, but it was too late.

      The tip of her sword pointed out his dad's back after perforating its way in. Blood dripped from the sword and soaked his cloth. As It went through his heart the light in his eyes dimmed then disappeared forever as he hit the ground.

     Betty's screams deafened his ears as Filimon instinctively limped towards the woman. His fingernails dug against his palm as he made a tight clutch. The woman slapped his mom to stop her screaming and turned towards Filimon as he reached her. She easily dodged his punch, and swiped at his feet. He was taken off the ground and  landed on his back with such immense force. The air blew out of him and his vision swirled. Her face appeared above him and he knew it was no one but this woman who was going to bring him death. He saw the nasty grin that was plastered on her face as his vision cleared. She was holding the bloodied machete in her hand.

      The unnerving smile was  immediately wiped off her face when she suddenly looked sideways . She slowly started walking to the group of kids who scrambled at her approach. Filimon strained his neck to see what was happening and he saw Betty pointing a gun at the woman. The woman dropped the machete to the floor, sweet talking Betty to drop the gun. Betty fired.

      The alleyway echoed with the sound of gunshot as the bullet hit the wall beside the woman. Betty was pushed back with the force of the shot. "I wasn't going to hurt you... " the woman snarled  rising from her crouched position and walking towards her "I've changed my mind, you little bitch!" she said as she pulled Betty up by the hair.

     Betty was still smiling when the woman pointed the gun at her head. She didn't cry or drop her eyes. She stared at the woman with frightened but brave eyes as she awaited what her dad had told her "the train to God's house." She closed her eyes to imagine the beautiful white train, and when she opened them, she found the woman stumbling to her knees. Her neck was slit open, looking like a brand-new mouth carved just below her neck, the blood spilling out imitating a playful tongue. She made a gargling sound as Filimon  kicked her down, making sure the gargle meant her end this time. He looked up at his sister and said, "we need to go"

                                \* \* \* \* \* \*

    They approached the high grounded clearing at midnight. Betty, her brother, mom and only a few kids have been hiding and running through the forest for hours until the sound of the chasers couldn't be heard anymore. Half a dozen stick-men arrived to the alley as soon as they were going to run into the forest behind it. Most of the kids were too afraid to run away, but few ran into the closest thing to freedom with Filimon at their front.

Betty walked up to the edge of the cliff where her brother was standing looking at the burning main city. Her mother was sitting on the ground chanting something that sounded like "alone...death...so cold...red...red..." repeatedly. They not only lost their father, but their mother was gone too.

"Dad was right" Filimon said. It seemed like he has aged years in just a few hours. His lips were pulled firm, swallowing the innocent and gentle smile he used to give her. His eyes were narrowed and his little wrinkles appeared to be magnified. Betty thought she was seeing a smaller version of her father. "He was right about this being a revolution. A Massacre. It wasn't just on our town, the whole city is burning. Maybe the whole country. This is a war against a nation."

He turned toward her and kneeled down. "But I know somewhere will be safe, and wherever it is I'll get us there. I'll get you there, Beth. I promise I'll always be here" Betty was crying now. "I promise I'll always protect you."

"And I'll...I'll protect you too, Fili" she said and hugged him tight. She could see the burning sky in front of her. And she knew she'd find the bright sky and stars within her. She'd found it between her brother's arms.

They would walk on, leaving fire and death behind them.

They would go on, into fire and death.
