How small can you make a car? Well, that’s an interesting question, but we first need to know what we’re calling a car. So, what’s a car?



Cars are commonly defined as wheeled self-propelled vehicles used for transportation. Let’s ignore the transportation part for now though, it’s superfluous. Most cars have four wheels, so we can define a car as follows for our purposes: a device that moves on four wheels powered by a motor. That motor could be anything; it could be an internal combustion engine or an electric motor.



The world’s best selling car is the Toyota Corolla, and even though it has had many changes in form over the last half-century, it is probably still the car with the strongest claim to being the ‘normal’. The 2014 Toyota Corolla is some 5 meters long, 2 meters wide, and 1.5 meters high, and I think that is as good as any estimate for an average car.



Of course, we could make this smaller; all modern cars have safety and durability features that take up space. They also have to hold people inside them, and people are not exactly the easiest thing to store. Harvard’s Bionumbers Database puts the mean volume of the human body at 65.22 liters; that’s 0.06522 cubic meters, but the amenities they require like comfortable seats, keeping the wind out, and - this is frankly ridiculous - not sitting on top of each other means a lot of space is wasted on a few humans. If we get rid of all that, then we will have disposed of a significant volume, and we put the engine in the middle instead of the front, then we will have significant savings. The Lunar Roving Vehicle - commonly known as the moon buggy - from the last few Apollo missions was roughly the size of two people, and was very conservative with space, for example.



That’s a moot point anyway. We already have toy cars roughly the size of a book and smaller that fulfill all of our requirements; they are self-propelled with a motor, usually electric for these, and they have four wheels. But can we get much smaller?



This is where things get a little theoretical, but that isn’t too much of a problem. Science is powered by twin engines of imagination and experiment, after all. So let’s imagine away. For example, let’s have a look at the cilia of cells.



In cells, we have a lot of consistent linear motion. For example, a class of proteins called Dyneins (and another called Kinesins) create a walking motion on the microtubules that permeate cells. In a cilium, you have a sort of ring of these microtubules and when you attach the tail of the walking dynein molecule to a microtubule while the other end ‘walks’ on another microtubule, a sort of sliding motion between the two is created. If the microtubules are surrounded by a membrane, they are essentially a single structure where one side is growing longer than the other, so it bends. This is essentially how cell flagella and cilia work. Now, you might ask, “What does this have to do with a car?” Well, if a consistent back-and-forth motion can be generated, then you can build a reciprocating engine, changing linear motion into rotational motion. So, hypothetically, you could build a car on scales of around 10 micrometers - the length of a single cilium.



Why stop here though? There are molecules that can walk given some specific conditions, so are there any that can rotate? Well, the answer is yes. Some molecules were designed, both intelligently and by nature, to have a difference in potential when rotating in one direction as compared to the other. ATP-Synthase is one example of this; the passage of protons through one part of it causes a counterclockwise rotation. While the rotating part of ATP-Synthase is covered by another part of the enzyme, perhaps they could be separated. If that could be done while keeping the rotational function, then we could for example connect the bases of 4 F1 subunits - what the rotating parts are called - to a proton-filled vesicle. You then connect each of their heads to a wheel molecule like a C60 fullerene, creating a self-propelling vehicle. The F1 subunit has a diameter of about 9 nanometers, so you could conceivably build a vehicle on a scale of about 100 nm. That is absolutely tiny. And here’s the thing; scientists have built motors much, much smaller. The 2016 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was shared by Dr. Ben Feringa and two others for their work in molecular machines. Feringa and his team had built a single molecule that, under some light and thermally induced isomerizations, that could rotate in a single direction.



Of course, many of these are all hypotheticals and conjectures at best, and I can’t even remotely see a scenario where a car that small might actually be useful, but I think it’s this kind of aimless exploration of the things the universe does that truly leads to the most radical innovations and shifts in society. So, who knows? Maybe ‘movie nanotech’ is possible. We won’t know until we try everything.
