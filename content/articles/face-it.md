From the childhood memory captured in our mind,
From the hide and seek the game we played. 
We are ment to be hidden 
From those who seek us.
From those who seek us
For a little while, we had to be surrounded by fear.
We have to feel it though running from it
But in the end we will be captured 
We buy time as we could we run far as we should 
But time doesn't change fear does it
Some day somehow we ought to face it
So why waste time maybe fear isn't as scary as we thought
